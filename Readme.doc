This project ADC HX711 for micro voltmeter measurement
i use ancient language programming BASCOM-8051 on 89C52RC MCU
Does anyone here like this basic compiler ?
HX711 is Analog Digital Converter with true 24bit
you can test the bit 1-24 has true false, 25 to the rest is only true condition
the location analog bits is very very tiny about below nano volt precision.
need make more not detailed response so we can use it. :\

being work at it now...
dc measurement about (1:2 poin)
166611xxx - 1.345v
166609xxx - 1.344v
166607xxx- 1.343v

still confuse ac mili volt range @_@
(schematic on process...)

update 25.jan.21
i think... i must abandoned this project.
HX711 only has 80mV range, -40mV to +40mV sinuswave form.
reason: voltmeter when reach under mV, is very difficult to make it constant.
